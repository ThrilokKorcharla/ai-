# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 📦 Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook digit_recognition.ipynb
```

## 📈 Results
- Achieves >98% accuracy on test data.
- Demonstrates prediction and visualization of handwritten digits.

## 📂 Files
- `digit_recognition.ipynb`: Main notebook with training and testing code.
- `requirements.txt`: Required libraries.
- `model.h5`: Trained model file (after running the notebook).
